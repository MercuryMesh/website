There is a lot going on with the mercurymesh project! This blog post showcases the first vehicle prototype! As you will see in the attached video, the vehicle is moving when commanded with a wireless controller. The next steps will be adding the sensors for enviroment detection, adding computer vison, and automating the system to navigate on its own.
